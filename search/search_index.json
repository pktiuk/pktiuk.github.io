My github account: here ( some statistics ) My gitlab account: here My Recent Projects AntimicroX This is my main side-project for now. I deal with development and regular maintienance of this project. This is developed under AntiMicroX organization . Sjopinie Simple website used for collecting opinions about language lectorates at university. (Still in development, not deployed yet). My Older Projects KNR Selfie - autonomus car Selfie is the student project of autonomous cars. It is one of the projects realized by KNR (Students' Robotics Association) . This vehicle is prepared for CaroloCup competition, where vehicles in scale 1:10 are customized to be able to operate autonomously in simulated road environments. They are equipped with camera, computer vision computing unit, controller and set of sensors like magnetic encoders, distance sensors and IMU. This car started in CaroloCup competition in: 2020 Carolo-Basic-Cup 2-nd place \ud83e\udd48 2021 Carolo-Basic-Cup 1-st place\ud83e\udd47 2022 Carolo-Master-Cup 3-rd place \ud83e\udd49 Software of this car was built using ROS (Robot Operating System). My contributions visible in public codebase from 2020 detect_parking_spot - node detecting free parking spot in parking zone selfie_intersection - node controlling car when intersection is detected lane_controller - node detecting and overtaking obstacles on road Selfie- CaroloCup 2020 main repository Mylang logo Parser and interpreter of simple programming language with functionality similar to Logo language equipped with object-like turtle management. Example code in this language t = Turtle () t . fd ( 50 ) t . rotate ( 90 ) t . fd ( 50 ) print ( \"Current x: \" ) print ( t . get_x ()) print ( \" y: \" ) println ( t . get_y ()) This would print: Current x: 50 y: 50 and draw: Genetic circles/Evolutionary painter Simple app trying to recreate chosen picture by drawing multiple rectangles. It utilizes simple genetic algorithm to do it.
