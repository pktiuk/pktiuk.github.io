## My Older Projects

### KNR Selfie - autonomus car

Selfie is the student project of autonomous cars. It is one of the projects realized by [KNR (Students' Robotics Association)](https://knr.edu.pl/). This vehicle is prepared for CaroloCup competition, where vehicles in scale 1:10 are customized to be able to operate autonomously in simulated road environments. They are equipped with camera, computer vision computing unit, controller and set of sensors like magnetic encoders, distance sensors and IMU.

This car started in CaroloCup competition in:

- 2020 Carolo-Basic-Cup 2-nd place ðŸ¥ˆ
- 2021 Carolo-Basic-Cup 1-st placeðŸ¥‡
- 2022 Carolo-Master-Cup 3-rd place ðŸ¥‰

Software of this car was built using ROS (Robot Operating System).
