### Selfie 2020
Selfie is the student project of autonomous cars. Vehicles based on 1:10 scale RC cars are customized to be able to operate autonomously in simulated road environments. They are equipped with camera, computer vision computing unit, controller and set of sensors like magnetic encoders, distance sensors and IMU.
